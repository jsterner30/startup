## Class Notes

### Internet History
  The internet is made up of a huge network of computers. It is governed by certain bodies, including those that control DNS. Over the years, we have gone from just being able to have words on a page with HTML to having styling and interactivity with javascript. 
  
### The Internet
  The internet globally connects independent networks and computing devices using the TCP/IP model. Understanding the basics of how the internet works provides you with a mental model for effectively creating web applications. At the top of the TCP/IP protocol is the application layer. It represents user functionality, such as the web (HTTP), mail (SMTP), files (FTP), remote shell (SSH), and chat (IRC).\
 
  When one device what to talk to another it must have an IP address. You can determine the hops in a connection using the traceroute console utility.
 
 ### Web Servers
  Web servers are computers that are dedicated to serving up webpages on the internet. They have different ports that, when connected with an IP address, allow you to query the computer using http or https. Today, many people run thier servers through AWS or other cloud computing option. 
  
### AWS EC2
  An EC2 is an AWS web server that you can pay to use. It functions like an onprem server, except it is not on-prem. You can ssh into it to control it. 
  
### Domain Names
  Domain names are human readable urls that front an ip address. You can easily buy an domain name with AWS through a service called Route 53. 
  
### HTTP vs HTTPS
  HTTP is the protocol that computers use to communicate. HTTPS is a secure version of that protocol. For a long time, there was a monopoly over https, and it was very expensive to get a certificate. Since 2014, there has been a free, open-source solution. Now every website should use https .
  
### HTML
  HTML is a way to structure and display text on a website. It has opening tags (<>) and closing tags (</>).
  
### HTML Structure
  There are two main types of HTML tags: inline and block. Block tags take up an entire block of the screen. Inline tags stay next to each other. 
  
### HTML Input
  There are lots of nifty ways to get iput using HTML. These include:
    
| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |

| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

  There are also many input types:

### HTML Media
  You can input media like images and videos into HTML. Here is an example of an img:
 <img
  alt="mountain landscape"
  src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg"
/>

Note that the file should be the shortest possible resolvable filepath. 


### CSS 
  CSS (Cascading style sheets) is a way to add style like color and fonts to a webpage. 

### CSS Selectors
  The first step in understanding CSS is mastering how to select the elements that a CSS rule applies to. The CSS rule selector can take many forms. In order to explain the most common selectors we need some demonstration HTML. Let's image a simple document describing the departments in a university. In our case we have a physics and a chemistry department. The information provided is very sparse, but the structure provided by the HTML is enough to work with.
  
 ### CSS Declerations
  CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

  You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, a the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (px) or inches (in). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (50%), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (25vmin), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (1.5rem) as defined by the root element.
  
  | Unit | Description                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| px   | The number of pixels                                             |
| pt   | The number of points (1/72 of an inch)                           |
| in   | The number of inches                                             |
| cm   | The number of centimeters                                        |
| %    | A percentage of the parent element                               |
| em   | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the parent's font |
| rem  | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the root's font   |
| ex   | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                 |
| vw   | A percentage of the viewport's width                             |
| vh   | A percentage of the viewport's height                            |
| vmin | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                 |
| vmax | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                  |

There are multiple ways to define colors:

| Method       | Example                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| HSL          | `hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)` | Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is. |


### CSS Fonts
Choosing appropriate fonts is a key web application design characteristic. A beautiful modern font will make your application enjoyable to use. Picking a hard to read font, an overused font, or using too many fonts will turn users away.

The CSS font-family property defines what fonts should be used. The property value represents an ordered list of fonts. The first font in the list that is available will be used. This ability to select from a list of fonts is important because different operating systems have different default fonts and your first choice may not be available.

In addition to referencing standard fonts found on the user's computer you can specify a font that you provide with your application. That way your application is guaranteed to always look the same. In order to have the browser load a font you use the @font-face rule and provide the font name and source location.

### CSS Animation
Using CSS to animate your components is an easy way to make your application feel alive and interactive. You create CSS animations using the animation properties and defining keyframes for what the element should look like a different times in the animation. Let's walk through an example.
